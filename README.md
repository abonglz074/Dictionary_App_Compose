# Dictionary_App_Compose
Clean architecture.
Retrofit for getting definitions from API,
Room for cache,
Coroutines for async,
Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection.
Simple dictionary application that can take the definitions of the words from https://dictionaryapi.dev/. Then save it in cache. After that we can restore words definitions from database without internet connection.
